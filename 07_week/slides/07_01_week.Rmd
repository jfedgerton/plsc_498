# Quick Recap

- Last time, we focused on:
  - distributions (histograms vs densities)
  - overplotting (alpha, jitter, binning, contours)
  - ggplot "knobs": mapping vs styling vs stat vs position

Today, we focus on **comparing distributions responsibly**:

- ECDFs (fewer tuning knobs)
- Q–Q plots (diagnosis by quantiles)
- many distributions at once (groups, time)
- multipanel figures (small multiples as arguments)

---

# Simulated data for today


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2); library(dplyr); library(tidyr); library(forcats)
set.seed(123)
df <- tibble(
  id = 1:1500,
  group = sample(c("Group A", "Group B", "Group C"), size = 1500, replace = TRUE,
                 prob = c(0.40, 0.35, 0.25)),
  period = sample(paste0("Period ", 1:6), size = 1500, replace = TRUE))
out_a <- rnorm(1500, mean = 55, sd = 10); out_b <- rgamma(1500, shape = 3, scale = 12); out_c <- rlnorm(1500, meanlog = 3.7, sdlog = 0.55)
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    outcome = case_when(group == "Group A" ~ out_a, group == "Group B" ~ out_b, group == "Group C" ~ out_c),
    outcome = outcome + as.numeric(factor(period)) * 2 + rnorm(1500, 0, 3),
    outcome = pmax(outcome, 0.1),
    outcome_round = round(outcome / 5) * 5,
    outcome_log10 = log10(outcome + 1))
df %>% slice(1:3)
```

# Why ECDFs?

Histograms and densities require choices:

- bin width (histogram)
- bandwidth (density)

ECDFs reduce tuning knobs:

- you always see the whole distribution
- you can read off **quantiles** directly
- you can answer threshold questions ("what fraction is below X?")

---

# ECDF: one distribution

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome)) +
  stat_ecdf(linewidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Outcome",
    y = "Fraction at or below x",
    title = "ECDF (overall)"
  )
```

---

# ECDF: compare groups (few groups)

Overlay works best when:

- you have a small number of groups
- you can keep the legend readable

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome, color = group)) +
  stat_ecdf(linewidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Outcome", y = "Fraction at or below x", title = "ECDF by group")
```

---

# ECDF as a question: "below a threshold"

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
threshold <- 80

ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome, color = group)) +
  stat_ecdf(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = threshold, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Outcome",
    y = "Fraction at or below x",
    title = "Reading an ECDF as a threshold argument",
    subtitle = "At the dashed line: compare the vertical positions of the ECDFs"
  )
```

---

# Descending ECDF: emphasize the tail

Sometimes the tail is the story. A descending ECDF answers "what fraction is **at or above** x?"

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df_dec <- df %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  arrange(outcome, .by_group = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(ecdf = row_number() / n(),
         dec_ecdf = 1 - ecdf) %>% 
  ungroup()
ggplot(df_dec, aes(x = outcome, y = dec_ecdf, color = group)) +
  geom_step(linewidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Outcome", y = "Fraction at or above x", title = "Descending ECDF by group")
```

---

# Log scale reveal structure

When the right tail collapses everything: (a) a log axis can spread out the tail, (b) interpretation changes: equal distances = multiplicative change

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome, color = group)) +
  stat_ecdf(linewidth = 1) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Outcome (log10 axis)", y = "Fraction at or below x", title = "ECDF on a log-scaled x-axis")
```

---

# Data visualization critique 

- Take five minutes
  - What variables are mapped to what (x/y/color/size/etc.)?
  - Is it persuasive?
  - What design choices did they make?
  - After doing this, talk to your neighbor briefly and compare notes.

# Q–Q plots: comparing quantiles

A Q–Q plot compares:

- quantiles of your data
- to quantiles of a reference distribution (often normal)

Interpretation:

- points on a straight line → close to reference
- systematic curves → skew / heavy tails / truncation

---

# Q–Q plot (overall): normal reference

```{r, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(sample = outcome)) +
  stat_qq(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) +
  stat_qq_line(linewidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Q–Q plot vs Normal (overall)", x = "Theoretical quantiles (Normal)", y = "Observed quantiles (Outcome)")
```

---

# Q–Q plots by group (small multiples)

Small multiples help because: (a) the reference is identical in every panel and (b) shape differences become visible without legend overload

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3.65, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(sample = outcome)) +
  stat_qq(alpha = 0.35, size = 0.9) +
  stat_qq_line(linewidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ group, nrow = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Q–Q plots by group (Normal reference)", x = "Theoretical quantiles (Normal)", y = "Observed quantiles (Outcome)")
```

---

# Reading Q–Q deviations

Look for:

- **right tail above the line** → heavier right tail than normal
- **left tail below the line** → heavier left tail than normal
- **S-shape** → skewness
- **flat ends** → ceilings / floors / truncation

---

# Pause and discuss with a neighbor

You have two distribution diagnostics:

1) ECDF  
2) Q–Q plot vs normal

**Prompt:**

- Which plot is better for comparing *groups*?
- Which plot is better for diagnosing *non-normality*?
- What could each plot hide?

---

# Many distributions: why mean + error bars can fail

Mean + error bars often hide what matters:

- different shapes can share the same mean
- "error bars" are ambiguous (SE? SD? CI?)
- distributions are rarely symmetric

If the claim is about *variation*, show variation.

---

# Boxplots: compact, many groups

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = fct_reorder(group, outcome, .fun = median), y = outcome)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Group (ordered by median)", y = "Outcome", title = "Boxplots by group")
```

---

# Boxplot + points: show individuals

When sample size is moderate: (a) show raw points and (b) reduce overlap with jitter + alpha

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(df, aes(x = fct_reorder(group, outcome, .fun = median), y = outcome)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.15, height = 0), alpha = 0.25, size = 1.2) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.35, outlier.alpha = 0.0) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Group (ordered by median)", y = "Outcome", title = "Boxplots with jittered raw points")
```

---

# Violin plots: shape + summary 

Violin plots are densities by group: (a) they can reveal multimodality and (b) they can also imply precision you do not have (small n)

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = fct_reorder(group, outcome, .fun = median), y = outcome)) +
  geom_violin(trim = TRUE, alpha = 0.4) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Group (ordered by median)", y = "Outcome", title = "Violin plots by group")
```

---

# Distributions across an ordered variable

When groups change over time:  (a) comparing means can miss distribution shifts and (b) small multiples (or ridgelines) can show drift and widening/narrowing


```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome)) +
  geom_density(linewidth = 1) +
  facet_grid(group ~ period) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Outcome", y = "Density", title = "Many distributions at once (small multiples)")
```

---

# Optional: ridgelines (if installed)

Ridgelines can work well when: (a) the x-axis is identical across panels and (b) the y-axis is an ordered variable (e.g., time). If you get an error, install once:
`install.packages("ggridges")`

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome, y = period, fill = period)) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 1.2, alpha = 0.6, color = "white", linewidth = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ group, nrow = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Outcome", y = "Period", title = "Ridgelines by group (ordered distributions)")
```

---

# Data visualization critique 

- Take five minutes
  - What is the plot comparing: **shape** or **totals**?
  - Do the design choices make comparisons easy?
  - What would change if you used an ECDF instead?
  - After doing this, talk to your neighbor briefly and compare notes.

# Multipanel figures: small multiples vs clutter

Small multiples (facets) are powerful because:

- they keep encodings consistent
- they reduce legend gymnastics
- they make comparisons the *default* task

But they require discipline:

- consistent axes when comparing magnitude
- meaningful ordering of panels

---

# Facets: a concrete multipanel argument

```{r, fig.width=7.2, fig.height=3.8, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome, color = group)) +
  stat_ecdf(linewidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ period, nrow = 2) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Outcome",
    y = "Fraction at or below x",
    title = "ECDFs across an ordered variable (facets)",
    subtitle = "Same encoding, repeated panels"
  )
```

---

# A common pitfall

If your goal is to compare magnitudes across panels: **free scales** can create misleading "same shape = same size" impressions

Use free scales only when the question is: "what is the *within-panel* pattern?"

```{r, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=3.4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome)) +
  stat_ecdf(linewidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free_x", nrow = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Outcome (free x-scale per panel)", y = "Fraction at or below x", title = "Caution: free scales change the comparison")
```

---

# Tie it back to ggplot decisions

Every plot we made was a choice among:

- **mapping**: `aes(x = ...)`, `aes(color = group)`
- **stat**: `stat_ecdf()`, `stat_qq()`, `geom_density()`
- **position**: jittering points, arranging panels
- **scales / coords**: log axis, free vs fixed facet scales
- **multipanel layout**: facet grid vs facet wrap

---

# Saving a figure (reproducible output)

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p_save <- ggplot(df, aes(x = outcome, color = group)) +
  stat_ecdf(linewidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Outcome",
    y = "Fraction at or below x",
    title = "ECDF by group"
  )

ggsave(
  filename = "ecdf_by_group.png",
  plot = p_save,
  width = 7,
  height = 4,
  dpi = 300
)
```

---

# What success looks like

- You can choose an ECDF when you want fewer tuning knobs
- You can use Q–Q plots to diagnose departures from a reference distribution
- You can compare many distributions without hiding shape
- You can justify multipanel layout decisions:
  - fixed vs free scales
  - ordering and readability

---

# In-Class Activity

Find a visualization online.

With a neighbor:
- Identify the data variables
- Identify the visual mappings
- Decide what message the plot is making
- Suggest one concrete improvement

---

# What Comes Next

Next, we will keep building:

- stronger multipanel design habits (annotation, labeling, redundancy)
- composing multiple plots into a single argument
- avoiding “default clutter” as figures get more complex

Focus on clarity, not complexity.
